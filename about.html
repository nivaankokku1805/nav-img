    Our Founder Chairman, Late Shri Niranjanlal Dalmia, was a visionary who walked the untrodden path to serve humanity.
    Conscious of the fact that education is crucial in fighting poverty, he provided assistance to educate the children from
    the economically weaker section of the society. With a noble intention of widening his philanthropic reach, this great
    visionary, academician and educationist formed the N. L. Dalmia Educational Society. This service by the Society
    presented an opportunity for numerous children to join schools in the ensuing years.
    
    One great thought led to another and in 1987, Shri Niranjanlal Dalmia decided to start a school. By the end of 1990, the
    construction of this school was completed at Mira Road, and in 1991 N. L. Dalmia High School opened its gates to a
    bright future for generations to come. With a vision to provide quality management knowledge, thereafter in 1997, N. L.
    Dalmia Institute of Management Studies and Research was established.
    
    Shri Niranjanlal Dalmia always believed that for the country’s progress, it is important to educate its citizens. N. L.
    Dalmia High School was his step in this direction and today after years of sincere hard work, thousands of students have
    successfully passed out of this institution, indicative of our Babuji’s dream come true.
    
    Mission
    The Mission of N. L. Dalmia High School is to provide an excellent education to its students who are at a crucial
    transitioning stage of their lives.
    
    The management and staff of N. L. Dalmia High School are committed to providing high quality and sound infrastructure
    and creating a safe, secure and nurturing environment in which all children can develop as holistic individuals and
    achieve success in life.
    
    We realize the importance of providing our faculty with an atmosphere conducive to teaching and learning so that they
    can give their very best. With regular and compulsory in-house training programmes, we aim to equip them with the latest
    educational aids and tools which complement and help them share their knowledge with our children to make learning an
    enjoyable and exciting experience.
    
    We are committed to create and maintain an orderly, trusting and caring environment, keeping interests of the child
    first. We have high morals and conduct our affairs in a sincere and orderly manner,</p>
